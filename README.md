# Voron Config

Klipper configuration for my Voron 2.4 350 printer it is based on great config repo [voron-ht](https://github.com/rpanfili/voron-ht)


## Setup
I'm running [klipper firmware](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper) on a RaspberryPi4 with [Mainsail](https://github.com/meteyou/mainsail) connected via usb to two SKR 1.4 turbo board.


## TODO
In the future there will be configs for SKR 1.3/SK 1.4 and Spider. I'm developing another one Voron, but the current one got one SKR 1.4 bricked (I replaced to 1.3)
